# Project Alnair

### Our Vision
  
AI workloads will be the critical/dominant workloads for cloud and edge computing. Current cloud/edge systems leverage existing hardware/software architecture to support new AI workloads, which limited the capability of AI training/inferencing and also increased the serving cost. More efficient and more intelligent hardware/software frameworks and architectures are needed to support AI workloads. We (Centaurus AI SIG) will focus on the resources management aspects, to analyze and schedule AI workloads on existing/new systems, with intelligent methods. In a long term, we also explore new architecture to orchestrate heterogenous resources, and new service model to facilitate AI workloads.

### Project Goal: Building an intelligent platform to improve AI workloads efficiency

- Elastic platform with self-learning capability
  - Elastic training, dynamic GPU allocation  
  - GPU utilization profiling, precise resource management
  - GPU fine-grained sharing, optimized resource utilization
  - Autonomous scheduler, continuous scheduling decision learning, policy improvement  
- Optimized ML framework
  - Parallelism (data/model/pipeline) Optimization
  - Hyperparameters auto tuning

### More about project roadmap and milestones are coming soon...
