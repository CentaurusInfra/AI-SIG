# Project: CPU Offload

### Background information
  
AI jobs (training and inferencing) in hte cloud are normally handled by the collaboration of CPU and GPU to get the best performance. There are 4 major steps in the AI workflow: I. task preparation II. data feeding III. AI model computing IV. result retrieving/reporting. CPU is responsible for steps I. II. IV. GPU
