2. cluster installation script

## PV/PVC Configurations

## Data Preloading

## Pod yaml exmaple with Alluxio


## Sample Results on data loading speed with and without Alluxio
1. within CPU cluster (cpu workloads)
2. cross CPU and GPU network (gpu workloads)

## Notes
1. user data/path isolation
2. network bottleneck
